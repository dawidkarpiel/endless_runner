# endless_runner

Task:
Write an endless runner in which we steer the cube and avoid obstacles.
Cube moves forward automatically and can move left and right and jump over obstacles.
The obstacles should have a modular structure that can easily be extended with new patterns.
Input should support the mobile + standalone platform.
The game should remember the best score.
The game should be optimized for mobile devices.
Suggested use of libraries: Dotween / Zenject (Extenject).

The whole task should be done as if 10 people were to work on this project over the next two years.
